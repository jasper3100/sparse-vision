Most of these files might be faulty. I used "imagenet_train_filenames_old.txt", but this file doesn't contain all train filenames because I still had partial=False in the dataloading, meaning that partial batches (smaller than the batch size) were not considered. Hence, some files were not considered. This I changed. Hence, "imagenet_train_filenames.txt" now contains the filenames of all 1,281,167 training images (as evident by the number of lines of this file).
